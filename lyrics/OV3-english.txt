Don’t need Prince Charming, ain’t got time for love

언니s all over me they say I’m young and naive 
I’m sorry sorry I’m never gonna grow up Nope

Don’t bring me down ‘cause I dare to be different
I’m a little dalla dalla dalla
Not gonna change who I am for your comfort
So watch and learn, I’ll show you what I’m about

Look in the mirror, loving what I see
